# Contributing

The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. 

If you wish to contribute to the Lucia codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use Prettier to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
is a great boon to your development process.

## Setup

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **master** branch
2. Run `npm install`
3. Code your heart out!
4. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/aidenybai/lucia/compare) (Make sure you follow the [conventional commit format](https://github.com/aidenybai/lucia/blob/master/.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md))
